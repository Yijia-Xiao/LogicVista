In January, the sales turnover was £274,299. To calculate the sales turnover needed for February, we can use the following formula:

February Sales Turnover = (January Sales Turnover \* (1 + Target Growth Rate)) / 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

February Sales Turnover = (£274,299 \* (1 + 0.015)) / 100
= £274,299 \* 1.015

To calculate the difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits, we can subtract the target from the actual Leisure profits.

Target: 1/4 of total profits
Actual Leisure profits: £1.8 million

So, the difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits is:

Target - Actual = (1/4) x (£1.8 million - £1.8 million) = -£1.8 million

Since the target was to have Leisure profits be a quarter of their total profits, the actual Leisure profits missed the target by -£1.8 million.

Team D: Direct Sales - No data, Telesales - £13 million

Therefore, the combined difference between direct sales and telesales across the five teams is:

£10 million (Team A) - No data (Team B) - No data (Team C) - No data (Team D) - No data (Team E) - No data

26% of the total sales for all regions = 26/100 \* £124 million = £32.4 million

In this case, the target was split equally across 5 salerooms, so we can calculate the target for each saleroom as follows:

1. Divide the total sales target by the number of salerooms: £400,000 / 5 = £80,000
2. Multiply the result by the percentage of the target that was achieved: 80% of £80,000 = £64,000

Now, we can find the individual sales target for each saleroom:
