The sequence of nucleotides on each strand is read from the top to bottom, and the four options for the missing base pair in each box represent the possibilities for the resulting nucleotide sequence.

Based on the DNA double helix structure, the missing base pair in each box should be the complementary base pair of the nucleotides in the other strand. Therefore, the correct option in each box is the one that completes the complementary pair.

For example, the first base pair in the top row has a nucleotide on the top strand and a nucleotide on the bottom strand, so the missing base in the first box should be the complementary nucleotide to the nucleotide on the bottom strand. This means that the correct option in the first box is A (guanine).

For example, if the pattern is A-B-C-D, then you would choose the letter corresponding to the first option in the grid, which is A.

C. The appearance of the tool is significantly more aesthetic with longer handles

The design of the bolt cutter allows for longer handles, making it more ergonomic and allowing easier storage. This feature improves the overall appearance of the tool, making it more visually appealing. A shorter handle would be less ergonomic and harder to hold onto, while a longer handle provides better leverage and control when cutting through thick bolts. B. It provides mechanical advantage which allows cutting through thick bolts. While longer handles may make the tool more ergonomic, they do not necessarily provide additional mechanical advantage in terms of cutting power. In fact, a longer handle could potentially make the tool more difficult to control and maneuver, particularly when cutting through tighter spaces or thicker materials. Additionally, the blade itself may have been designed to accommodate the length of the handle, so the handle does not necessarily provide additional cutting power. D. It makes the bolt cutter more durable when dropped accidentally. While the longer handles of this tool may make it more ergonomic, they are not necessarily designed to make the tool more durable when dropped accidentally.

This question requires the calculation of the annual saving for a Gem Plan customer compared to a Royal Plan customer, based on the number of minutes used per month. The table shows the number of minutes used per month for each plan, and the corresponding cost per minute. For example, if a Royal Plan customer uses 100 minutes per month, the cost per minute is $3.17, and the total monthly cost is $317.

The annual saving for a Gem Plan customer depends on the number of minutes used per month and the cost per minute. Let's assume that a Gem Plan customer uses 200 same network minutes and 150 other network minutes per month, for a total of 350 minutes per month. The cost per minute for same network minutes is 10 cents, and the cost per minute for other network minutes is 15 cents. Therefore, the total cost for 350 minutes is:

350 x 0.10 + 150 x 0.15 = 37.5 + 22.5 = 60

To find the refund amount for this Royal Plan customer, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes used. This can be done by adding the number of minutes in each of the three months and dividing by 3.

In month 1, the customer made 492 minutes of standard calls at 30p per minute, for a total cost of £136.

In month 2, the customer made 543 minutes of standard calls at 30p per minute, for a total cost of £173.

In month 3, the customer made 625 minutes of standard calls at 30p per minute, for a total cost of £207.

Therefore, the total number of minutes used over the three months is 492 + 543 + 625 = 1,650 minutes.

The cost of these minutes, divided by the number of minutes used, is £136 / 1,650 minutes = 0.081p per minute.

This means that the total cost of the minutes used is 1,650 x 0.081 = £135.8.

The government plays a role in determining the supply and demand of goods and services in the market. The government's policies can affect prices, wages, and the level of employment in an economy.

On the other hand, if the government provides subsidies to small businesses, it can increase the supply of goods and services in the market, leading to lower prices and higher levels of output.

Overall, the government's role in the market is complex, and its effects can be difficult to predict.
