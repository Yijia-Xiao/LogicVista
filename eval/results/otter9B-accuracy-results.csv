The structure of an system can be described using diagrams, which represent the system on paper.
An diagram can show an entire system or a part of the system.
A flow chart is a type of diagram that is often used to describe a sequence of events or steps.",0

The weight of an object is how much force it has because of its mass and the distance from the ground. So, to make the beam balance, you need to know what the mass of each object is.",1

425,v1_425,['mechanical'],['diagram'],['e'],"['a', 'b']","The answer is A clockwise and B clockwise. BECAUSE: In a gear system, the speed of an object is determined from the ratio between the number of teeth on a gear and the speed at which it is rotating. The faster a gear rotates, the more teeth it has. If the gears are connected in a chain, the gear with the most teeth will move the fastest.
If each of the satellite gears has 20 teeth, the outer ring with 100 teeth is moving five times faster than it. The sun gear with 25 teeth is also turning faster than the shaft, but it is only connected to one satellite gear. Therefore, the shaft is turning clockwise at a speed equal to the velocity of the inner gear (25 teeth) times the outer gear's speed (100 teeth) = 25 times 5 or 125 mph.",0

432,v1_432,['mechanical'],"['diagram', 'ocr']",['a'],['c'],"The answer is (C). BECAUSE: A surface area is the area of a flat surface. Every object has a surface area.
The surface area of an object is important because it helps you determine how water will flow over it. This is especially important for the aerodynamics, or the study of the forces that act on an object while it is moving in a surrounding fluid, like water.
A more aerodynamic surface area will have a higher speed and more of a streamlined shape.
This can lead to more efficient movement, which saves energy and can make it easier for an object to move, such as a boat through water or a plane in the sky.",0
