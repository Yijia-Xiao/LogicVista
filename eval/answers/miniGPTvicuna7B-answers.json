In fact, a longer handle could potentially make the tool more difficult to control and maneuver, particularly when cutting through tighter spaces or thicker materials. Additionally, the blade itself may have been designed to accommodate the length of the handle, so the handle does not necessarily provide additional cutting power. D.
