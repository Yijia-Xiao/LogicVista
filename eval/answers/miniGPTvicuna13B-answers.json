This is because each corner wheel has two spokes, and one spoke is pointing in the clockwise direction and the other is pointing in the counterclockwise direction. Therefore, six corners will spend anticlockwise.\n\n<Img>Image 1</Img> shows the direction of rotation of the wheels. As the string is pulled up, the wheels rotate in opposite directions. The top wheel, with two spokes pointing in a clockwise direction, will rotate in a clockwise direction. The bottom wheel, with two spokes pointing in a counterclockwise direction, will rotate in a counterclockwise direction. The remaining four wheels, each with one spoke pointing in a clockwise direction and one in a counterclockwise direction, will rotate in opposite directions to each other, so they will spend anticlockwise.", "reasoning": "none"}, "v1_443": {"answer": "\u200b\n\nThe spring that is compressed the farthest would be spring (A) because it is in the center and has the least amount of coils, so it would compress the most when pressed. The spring that is compressed the least would be spring (D), as it is at the end of the row and has the most number of coils, so it would compress the least when pressed.", "reasoning": "none"}, "v1_444": {"answer": "\u200b\n\nThe most likely to sink first would be option D, as it has the least amount of metal bars and is therefore the most buoyant. Option A would be second, as it has one more metal bar than option D but still less than options B and C. Option B would be third, as it has one more metal bar than option A but still less than option D. Option C would be fourth, as it has two more metal bars than option A but still less than option D. Option E would be last, as it has four more metal bars than option A and three more than option D.", "reasoning": "none"}, "v1_445": {"answer": "The water level would rise by 3 cubic meters of water.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a pool, the volume of water is conserved. Therefore, when three non-absorbent objects with a total volume of 2 cubic meters are half submerged in the pool, the water level will rise by the same amount as the volume of water displaced by the objects. As the volume of water displaced by the objects is 3 cubic meters, the water level will rise by 3 cubic meters.", "reasoning": "none"}, "v1_446": {"answer": "As the image is not provided, it's impossible to determine which of the options is the least likely to fall over from a powerful wind.", "reasoning": "none"}, "v1_447": {"answer": "\u200b\n\n(A) A. After 120 seconds of rotation, gear A will have hit the arrow the most number of times because it has more teeth than the other gears. The number of times each gear hits the arrow can be calculated by dividing the total number of teeth by the number of teeth on each gear. For example, gear A has 20 teeth and will hit the arrow 6 times (20/4=5, rounded up to 6). Gears B and C each have 10 teeth and will hit the arrow 2 times each. Gear D has 8 teeth and will hit the arrow 2 times, and all of the gears will hit the arrow the same number of times.", "reasoning": "none"}}
