For both the two basic figures, the lower part of the figure has therefore been colored black whereas the size has only been modified for the basic figure number 1. Since the common function figure is the hourglass, it can be deduced that its function is to color the lower half in black. Therefore, the diamond function must change the shape size. Consequently, the correct answer regarding the basic figure's appearance is answer D: the basic figure is a white circle. The function figure is that of the hourglass, whose function is to color the bottom half of the figure in black. Indeed, the final figure in D is a circle whose bottom half is colored black. Regarding the functional figure, the correct answer is answer B: the basic figure is a small white circle whereas the final figure is a large circle. This is a result of the diamond figure; whose function is to enlarge the shape.",

(A) The bubbles provide a downward thrust on the tank  (B) The metal increases in density so it gets heavier  (C) The bubbles lower the density of the water which lowers its buoyancy (D) Water replaces the air in the tank which makes it heavier (E) Impossible to tell",
        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "As air escapes the available space is quickly replaced with water, so the tank's density becomes the same as that of the water and with the added weight and density of the tank itself continues to sink.",

When the bucket is full there is a greater volume of water trying to exit the bucket via the hole. A greater volume of water is a greater mass of water and therefore exerts a greater pressure, the greater pressure translates to faster speed. As more water leaves the bucket via the hole the volume decreased, therefore so does the mass of the water and the pressure then drops",

        "answer": "C",
        "reasoning": "The correct answer is C. This question can be solved in a straightforward calculation of the volume of the granaries, using the formula of a cylinder volume: V = pi x R2 x H  Where: pi= 3.14, R is the cylinder radius, and H is the cylinder height.  Calculating: Answer A: 4 x 3.14 x 52 x 10 = 4 x 3.14 x 25 x 10 = 3.14 x 100 x 10 = 3,140   Answer B: 3.14 x 52 x 40 = 3.14 x 25 x 40 = 3.14 x 1,000 = 3,140        However, there is no need for such lengthy calculations. As we can see, the height of the cylinder affects the volume of a cylinder linearly, meaning 4 cylinders with height H are equal in volume to one cylinder with height 4H.  Remember the physical principle: The volume of a cylinder is linearly dependent on its height.    Note: The same does NOT apply to the cylinder\u2019s radius since the R in the formula is squared. In that case, the volume of one cylinder with a radius of 2R will be equal to the volume of four cylinders with a radius R. The volume of one cylinder with a radius of 4R will be equal to the volume of sixteen cylinders with a radius R.",

Air pressure in a balloon is generally determined by the amount of air it contains and the volume it occupies. A fully inflated balloon is generally stretched more tightly than a half-inflated balloon, and therefore, the air molecules inside are compressed into a smaller volume than they would be in a half-inflated balloon. This compression results in higher air pressure.  So, in this scenario, Balloon A, which is fully inflated, would generally have more air pressure inside it than Balloon B, which is only half-inflated.",

        "question": "The diagram shows two fixed cogwheels which can only rotate around their own axis. A rack is inserted between the two cogwheels and is moved in the direction shown by the arrow. What are the directions of movement and velocities of revolution of the cogwheels? Select from A, B,  C,  and D.  (A) Same direction, same velocities (B) Same direction, different velocities (C) Different directions, same velocities (D) Different directions, different velocities ",
        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "The correct answer is D. When contact is made between the rack (toothed belt) and the cogwheels a conversion from a linear velocity to an angular velocity occurs. Thus, the location of the point of contact is critical. We can see from the diagram that the point of contact between the red cogwheel and the rack is in the lower part of the red cogwheel, a position in which the linear velocity induces an angular velocity in a clockwise direction. In contrast, the point of contact between the grey cogwheel and the rack is in the upper part of the grey cogwheel, a position in which the linear velocity induces an angular velocity in a counter clockwise direction. It follows that the cogwheels rotate in opposite directions.  The thumb rule: fewer teeth, faster velocity,  which is based on the concept of gear ratio and enables us to conclude without unnecessary calculations that the grey cogwheel rotates much faster than the red cogwheel since it has fewer teeth.",

The formula to calculate the total resistance (RT) in a circuit where N resistors are connected in parallel is:  1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 .. + 1/RN If we substitute the values from the figure we get: 1/RT = 1/240 + 1/40 + 1/80 The common denominator is 240: 1/RT = 1/240 + 6/240 + 3/240 = (1+6+3)/240 = 10/240 = 1/24     This is the reciprocal value for RT (1/RT), thus - RT is 24 ohm.",

These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.  Therefore, following more rearrangements and simplifications;  4F = 3.50 - 0.50  4F = 3.00 F = 3.00/4  F = 0.75.",

Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",

Glass = = 4m\u00b2    Brick = (4 * 2) = 8m\u00b2     Wood = (4 * 2) = 8m\u00b2     Metal = (8 * 0.5) = 4m\u00b2      Now, that the required quantities of materials have been obtained we can work out their pricing per square metre. Brick, as stated in the question is \u00a3100/m\u00b2, whereas wood is \u00a390/m\u00b2, and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (\u00a390/m\u00b2 * 4) = \u00a3360/m\u00b2.

Brick = 8m\u00b2 * \u00a3100/m\u00b2 = \u00a3800      Wood = 8m\u00b2 * \u00a390/m\u00b2 = \u00a3720      Metal = 4m\u00b2 * \u00a3360/m\u00b2 = \u00a31,440      Multiply the prices for the materials by the quantities needed to obtain a price for each material for the house being built. Lastly, sum these prices to compare with the figure of \u00a311,000.   \u00a38,640 + \u00a3800 + \u00a3720 + \u00a31,440 = \u00a311,600.  Therefore, the answer is false as the house with 4m\u00b2 of glass does not cost less than \u00a311,000.",

This doesn't mean all Secretaries make \u00a310 an hour. Though we can say that all Accountants produce \u00a320 an hour. With these figures, we could say that Accountants always produce twice the amount as Secretaries because whether it's \u00a38 or \u00a310, it's at least twice.

Note 1: Notice that the graph gives change in R&D spend compared with previous year. So in 2009 the change compared to 2008 was -0.8% from the graph. It is NOT the difference between -1.8% and -0.8% (i.e. +1.0%).      Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.

If R&D overheads are projected to rise by 1.1% between 2009 and 2010, what is the 2010 predicted R&D sum left after overheads are taken in to account? Select from A, B, C, D and E. (A)1.02 million (B)1.22 million (C)2.11 million (D)2.21 million (E)2.48 million",
        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "Step 1- Total R&D spend in 2009 was 2,483.4 (thousands). So 2,483,400. Step 2- R&D overheads we are told are 12% of spend so 12% x 2,483,400 = 298,008. Step 3- The graph tells us that the R&D spend in 2010 is projected to increase by 1.2%. This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.   Step 4- So the available R&D money left after overheads is (2,513,200.8 minus 301,286.1) = 2,211,914.7.   Thus the correct answer is (D) 2.21 million",

The second disc on axle B is connected to a disc on axle C, and is once again half the diameter of the disc on C. So, for every one rotation of B, there is half a rotation of C. So, for every 1 rotation of A, there is 0.5 rotations of B, and therefore 0.25 rotations of C. If A is rotating at 100 RPM, then C is rotating at a quarter of that, or 25RPM.

        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "The correct answer is B. There are 2 ways to solve this question. Gear A has 20 teeth, and is rotating at 60 RPM (revolutions per minute), so for every minute that passes 60 rotations of a gear A occur, which means that 60 lots of 20 teeth have spun around and connected with one tooth of another gear, in this case B. And then every one tooth of gear B has connected with one of gear C. So, 60 * 20 = 1,200 teeth each minute, and as gear C has 40 teeth, this works out as 1,200 / 40 = 30 RPM. Also, gear A has half the number of teeth as gear C, so for every rotation of A, C performs half a rotation. Gear B merely transfers the rotation from A to C, without altering it.",

        "answer": "A",
        "reasoning": "The correct answer is A. The grid with the greater surface area will allow it to float easier. Likewise the smaller surface area will let it sink easier. As such, the first to think would be A - the grid with the smallest surface area",

        "answer": "E",
        "reasoning": "The correct answer is E. Three 2 cubic meter objects, totaling 6 cubic meters are submerged into a pool of water. They are non-absorbent, so the water does not occupy the same space. They are only half so much, so 6 is now halved to 3 cubic meters. Since it is being added to the water and not replacing the space, it will just rise by 3 cubic meters of water.",

        "reasoning": "The correct answer is E. The question is concerned with aerodynamics. Since the signs are not to scale, it is hard to tell which is the biggest or smallest - which would impact aerodynamic flow. The various holes in the signs would also impact aerodynamic flow, but are again to random in shape and position that it is impossible to tell which is the least likely to fall over from a powerful wind.",
